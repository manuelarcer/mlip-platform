## Install Python

You can install Python on Windows by following this tutorial:
[https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/install-python-windows-10](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/install-python-windows-10)

> **Important:** Python 3.11 is recommended. FAIRChem currently supports Python >=3.10 and <3.13. See [fairchem-core on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/fairchem-core/) for the latest compatibility information.

## Setup a Virtual Environment

A virtual environment isolates your Python packages for this project from other projects, preventing conflicts between dependencies.

Reference: [Python Packaging Guide - Virtual Environments](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#create-and-use-virtual-environments)

### 1. Create a virtual environment called 'uma'

In PowerShell within VSCode, navigate to a folder where you want your project. For example:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\YourUsername\Projects\MLIP
```

> **Note:** Replace `C:\Users\YourUsername\Projects\MLIP` with your preferred project directory path.

Then create the virtual environment:

```powershell
python -m venv uma
```

**Expected result:** You should see a new folder named `uma` created in your current directory. This folder contains the isolated Python environment.

### 2. Activate the virtual environment

```powershell
.\uma\Scripts\activate
```

**Expected result:** After running this command, your PowerShell prompt should change to show `(uma)` at the beginning. This indicates the virtual environment is active.

For example, your prompt should change from:
```
PS C:\Users\YourUsername\Projects\MLIP>
```
to:
```
(uma) PS C:\Users\YourUsername\Projects\MLIP>
```

### 3. Install pip

pip is the Python package manager used to install and update packages.

First, ensure pip is up to date:

```powershell
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

**Expected output:** You should see output showing the download and installation progress, ending with something like:
```
Successfully installed pip-25.3
```

Then verify pip is available:

```powershell
python -m pip --version
```

**Expected output:** You should see the pip version and its location, for example:
```
pip 25.3 from C:\Users\YourUsername\Projects\MLIP\uma\lib\site-packages\pip (python 3.11)
```

Now your isolated environment is ready to install the required packages.

## Setup MLIP-Platform

### 1. Install Git

Git is required to clone the MLIP-Platform repository.

**Installation steps:**

1. Go to the official Git website: [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. Download the latest x64 version of Git for Windows (e.g., version 2.51.2)
3. Double-click the downloaded `.exe` file to start installation
4. During installation, use the default settings, but pay attention to these key options:

| Setup Screen | Recommended Choice | Why |
|--------------|-------------------|-----|
| **Adjusting your PATH environment** | ✓ "Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software" | Allows you to use `git` in PowerShell or VSCode terminal |
| **Choosing the default editor** | "Vim" or "VS Code" (your preference) | VS Code is easier for most users |
| **Configuring line endings** | "Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings" | Recommended default for Windows |
| **Other options** | Leave as default | Safe for most users |

**Verify the installation:**

Open the PowerShell terminal in VSCode and run:

```powershell
git --version
```

**Expected output:**
```
(uma) PS C:\Users\YourUsername\Projects\MLIP> git --version
git version 2.51.0.windows.1
```

### 2. Clone the MLIP-Platform repository

Before cloning, make sure you're in your project directory and have activated the virtual environment:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\YourUsername\Projects\MLIP
.\uma\Scripts\activate
```

Clone the repository:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/manuelarcer/mlip-platform.git
cd mlip-platform
```

**Expected output:** You should see progress messages showing the cloning process:
```
Cloning into 'mlip-platform'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 836, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (157/157), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (90/90), done.
remote: Total 836 (delta 64), reused 132 (delta 56), pack-reused 679 (from 1)
Receiving objects: 100% (836/836), 21.25 MiB | 9.95 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (331/331), done.
```

After changing directory, your prompt should show:
```
(uma) PS C:\Users\YourUsername\Projects\MLIP\mlip-platform>
```

### 3. Install mlip-platform package

While in the `mlip-platform` directory, install the package in editable mode:

```powershell
pip install -e .
```

**What this does:** The `-e .` option installs the package in editable (development) mode, which means:
- Changes you make to the source code are immediately reflected without reinstalling
- The `mlip` command-line tool becomes available in your environment

**Expected output (last few lines):**
```
Successfully built mlip-platform
Installing collected packages: typing-extensions, click, olefile, fonttools, cycler, colorama, scipy, ...
Successfully installed ase-3.26.0 click-8.1.8 ... mlip-platform-4.15.0
```

**Verify installation:** The `mlip` CLI command should now be available whenever the 'uma' virtual environment is active.

## Setup UMA Model (FAIRChem)

The FAIRChem-Core library from the FAIR Chemistry team provides access to the UMA model and ASE integration.

Reference: [FAIRChem GitHub Repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairchem?tab=readme-ov-file#fairchem-by-the-fair-chemistry-team)

### 1. Install FAIRChem (fairchem-core)

From PowerShell (with your 'uma' venv activated), navigate back to your projects directory:

```powershell
cd ..
```

Your prompt should now show:
```
(uma) PS C:\Users\YourUsername\Projects\MLIP>
```

Install fairchem-core:

```powershell
pip install fairchem-core
```

Verify the installation:

```powershell
pip show fairchem-core
```

**Expected output:**
```
Name: fairchem-core
Version: 2.10.0
Summary: Machine learning models for chemistry and materials science by the FAIR Chemistry team
Home-page:
Author-email:
License: MIT License
Location: C:\Users\YourUsername\Projects\MLIP\uma\lib\site-packages
Requires: ase, ase-db-backend, Clustercope, e3nn, huggingface-hub, hydra-core, lmdb, monty, numba, numpy, orjson, pymatgen, requests, submitit, torch, torchviz, tqdm, wandb, websockets
```

### 2. Login to Hugging Face for UMA Model Access

The UMA model is gated on Hugging Face, requiring authentication to access.

#### Step 1: Create a Hugging Face account

If you don't already have one, sign up at: [https://huggingface.co/join](https://huggingface.co/join)

> **Important:** Use your work email address when signing up. Requests from personal email accounts may be rejected.

#### Step 2: Request access to the UMA model

1. Log in to your Hugging Face account
2. Navigate to the UMA model page: [https://huggingface.co/facebook/UMA](https://huggingface.co/facebook/UMA)
3. Click the button to request access or agree to the terms for the UMA model
4. Submit your access request

#### Step 3: Check your access status

1. Go to your **profile icon** (top right)
2. Select **Settings** → **Gated Repositories**
3. Look for the UMA model in the list

**What to look for:**
- **Status: ACCEPTED** means you have been granted access
- **Status: PENDING** means your request is under review
- The table shows columns: Repo Name, Type, Date, Request Status

#### Step 4: Generate an access token

1. Go to **profile icon** → **Settings** → **Access Tokens**
2. Click **"New Token"**
3. **Token name:** Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "uma-read-2025-11-03")
4. **Token type:** Select **"Read"** (this provides read-only access to gated models)
5. Click **"Create token"**
6. **Important:** Copy and save the generated token immediately - it will not be shown again!

#### Step 5: Login to Hugging Face from your terminal

Install the Hugging Face CLI tool (if not already installed):

```powershell
pip install huggingface_hub
```

Run the login command:

```powershell
hf auth login
```

**What happens:**
- You'll be prompted: `Token:` or `User is already logged in.`
- Paste your access token when prompted (it won't be visible as you paste)
- Press Enter

**Expected output on successful login:**
```
(uma) PS C:\Users\YourUsername\Projects\MLIP> hf auth login
User is already logged in.
```

Or if logging in for the first time, you'll see confirmation that the token has been saved.

**Note:** The token is saved in your user profile (`~/.huggingface/token`), so you typically only need to do this once per machine.

## You're All Set!

Your environment is now fully configured with:
- ✓ Python virtual environment ('uma')
- ✓ MLIP-Platform installed and `mlip` CLI available
- ✓ FAIRChem-Core installed with UMA model access

**Next steps:**
- Keep the 'uma' virtual environment activated when working with MLIP-Platform
- Use `mlip --help` to explore available commands
- Refer to the [main README](../README.md) for usage examples and documentation

**Troubleshooting tips:**
- If commands are not found, ensure the 'uma' virtual environment is activated (look for `(uma)` in your prompt)
- If UMA model downloads fail, verify your Hugging Face access status and that you've logged in with `hf auth login`
- On Windows, if you encounter execution policy errors, you may need to run: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`
